# search_algorithms_AI_class_project
This repo contains the files of an example projecct to show some search Algorithms related with Artificial Intelligence UPAEP class.

## Concept
The program displays a simple GUI showing a map with some obstacles in order to visualize how the selected search algorithm works and finds a solution. In this case, the solution is the path to exit the map, avoiding the obstacles.

## Main Classes
- AppGUI: manages the interface, includes the graphic map of the Map class.
- Algoritmo: computes the chosen search algorithm.
- Mapa: paints the obstacles and graphic map where the algorithm will work. The search method path is also painted here. 

## Showed Search Algorithms
- Breadth Search Algorithm
- Depth Search Algorithm
- Hill Climbing Algorithm
- Best First Algorithm
- A* Algorithm

## Usage/Examples

```
javac AppGUI.java
java AppGUI
